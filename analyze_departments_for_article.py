# UNBC Department Performance Analysis: A Deep Dive into RateMyProfessor Data

*Analysis Date: {datetime.now().strftime('%B %d, %Y')}*
*Data Source: RateMyProfessors.com*

## Executive Summary

An analysis of {len(professors)} professors across {len(departments)} departments at the University of Northern British Columbia reveals significant variations in student satisfaction and teaching effectiveness across academic units.

## Key Findings

### üèÜ Top Performing Departments by Rating

The highest-rated departments at UNBC are:

"""

for i, (dept, stats) in enumerate(by_rating[:5]):
    article += f"{i+1}. **{dept}** - {stats['avg_rating']:.2f}/5.0 average rating ({stats['rated_professors']} professors rated)\n"
    article += f"   - Star Professor: {stats['top_prof']['name']} ({stats['top_prof']['rating']}/5.0, {stats['top_prof']['numRatings']} reviews)\n"
    article += f"   - Would Take Again: {stats['avg_would_take_again']:.1f}%\n\n"

article += """
### üìä Largest Departments

The biggest departments by faculty count:

"""

for i, (dept, stats) in enumerate(by_size[:5]):
    article += f"{i+1}. **{dept}** - {stats['total_professors']} professors\n"
    article += f"   - Average Rating: {stats['avg_rating']:.2f}/5.0\n"
    article += f"   - Total Reviews: {stats['total_reviews']:,}\n\n"

article += """
### üí™ Most Challenging Departments

Students report these departments as the most difficult:

"""

for i, (dept, stats) in enumerate(by_difficulty[:5]):
    article += f"{i+1}. **{dept}** - {stats['avg_difficulty']:.2f}/5.0 difficulty\n"
    article += f"   - Average Rating: {stats['avg_rating']:.2f}/5.0\n"
    article += f"   - Most Challenging Prof: {stats['most_reviewed']['name']} ({stats['most_reviewed']['difficulty']}/5.0 difficulty)\n\n"

article += """
### üìà Most Engaged Departments

Departments with the most student reviews (indicating high engagement):

"""

for i, (dept, stats) in enumerate(by_reviews[:5]):
    article += f"{i+1}. **{dept}** - {stats['total_reviews']:,} total reviews\n"
    article += f"   - Average per professor: {stats['avg_reviews_per_prof']:.1f} reviews\n"
    article += f"   - Most Reviewed: {stats['most_reviewed']['name']} ({stats['most_reviewed']['numRatings']} reviews)\n\n"

# Add some interesting insights
high_rating_low_difficulty = [(d, s) for d, s in dept_stats.items() 
                               if s["avg_rating"] > 3.5 and s["avg_difficulty"] < 3.0 and s["rated_professors"] >= 3]
low_rating_high_difficulty = [(d, s) for d, s in dept_stats.items() 
                               if s["avg_rating"] < 3.0 and s["avg_difficulty"] > 3.5 and s["rated_professors"] >= 3]

## Notable Patterns

### üåü Hidden Gems (High Rating + Low Difficulty)

These departments offer the best of both worlds - great teaching with manageable difficulty:

"""

for dept, stats in sorted(high_rating_low_difficulty, key=lambda x: x[1]["avg_rating"], reverse=True)[:3]:
    article += f"- **{dept}**: {stats['avg_rating']:.2f}/5.0 rating, {stats['avg_difficulty']:.2f}/5.0 difficulty\n"

article += """
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenging Departments (Low Rating + High Difficulty)

Students find these departments particularly demanding:

"""

for dept, stats in sorted(low_rating_high_difficulty, key=lambda x: x[1]["avg_difficulty"], reverse=True)[:3]:
    article += f"- **{dept}**: {stats['avg_rating']:.2f}/5.0 rating, {stats['avg_difficulty']:.2f}/5.0 difficulty\n"

# Add statistical summary
article += f"""
## By The Numbers

- **Total Professors Analyzed**: {len(professors)}
- **Departments Evaluated**: {len(departments)}
- **Total Student Reviews**: {sum(s['total_reviews'] for s in dept_stats.values()):,}
- **Overall UNBC Rating**: {statistics.mean([p.get('rating', 0) for p in professors if p.get('rating')]):,.2f}/5.0
- **Overall UNBC Difficulty**: {statistics.mean([p.get('difficulty', 0) for p in professors if p.get('difficulty')]):,.2f}/5.0

## Methodology Note

This analysis is based on publicly available data from RateMyProfessors.com. Only departments with at least 3 rated professors were included in comparative rankings to ensure statistical validity. Individual experiences may vary, and these ratings represent aggregated student opinions rather than official evaluations.

## Recommendations for Students

1. **Course Planning**: Use department averages as a general guide, but always check individual professor ratings
2. **Balance Your Schedule**: Mix courses from high-difficulty and low-difficulty departments
3. **Read Reviews**: Look beyond ratings to understand teaching styles and course expectations
4. **Contribute**: Add your own reviews to help future students make informed decisions
